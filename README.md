# Datasette ML

> Bringing Machine Learning models near your data, not the other way around!

Datasette ML is a [Datasette](https://datasette.io) plugin providing an MLOps
platform to train, evaluate and make predictions from machine learning models.

All the underlying features are provided by [`sqlite-ml`](https://github.com/rclement/sqlite-ml).

## Installation

Install this plugin in the same environment as Datasette:

```bash
$ datasette install datasette-ml
```

## Usage

Define configuration within `metadata.yml` / `metadata.json`:

```yaml
plugins:
  datasette-ml:
    db: sqml
```

A new menu entry is now available, pointing at `/-/ml` to access the MLOps dashboard.

### Configuration properties

| Property | Type     | Description                                     |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `db`     | `string` | Database to store ML models (default is `sqml`) |

## Tutorial

Using `datasette-ml` you can start training Machine Learning models directly
along your data, simply by using custom SQL functions! Let's get started by
training a classifier against the famous "Iris Dataset" to predict flower types.

### Loading the dataset

First let's load our data. For a real world project, your data may live with its
own table or being accessed through an SQL view. For the purpose of this tutorial,
we can use the `sqml_load_dataset` function to load
[standard Scikit-Learn datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets):

```sql
SELECT sqml_load_dataset('iris') AS dataset;
```

It will return the following data:

| dataset |
| --- |
| {"table": "dataset_iris", "feature_names": ["sepal length (cm)", "sepal width (cm)", "petal length (cm)", "petal width (cm)"], "target_names": ["setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"], "size": 150} |

The Iris dataset is loaded into a table nammed `dataset_iris`,
containing 150 examples, 4 features and 3 classes to be predicted.

### Training a classifier

Now that our dataset is ready, let's train a first machine learning model to
perform a classification task using the `sqml_train` function:

```sql
SELECT sqml_train(
  'Iris prediction',
  'classification',
  'logistic_regression',
  'dataset_iris',
  'target'
) AS training;
```

It will return the following data:

| training |
| --- |
| {"experiment_name": "Iris prediction", "prediction_type": "classification", "algorithm": "logistic_regression", "deployed": true, "score": 0.9473684210526315} |

We have just trained our first machine learning model! The output data informs us
that our model has been trained, yields a score of 0.94 and has been deployed.

### Performing predictions

Now that we have trained our classifier, let's use it to make predictions!

Predict the target label for the first row of `dataset_iris` using the
`sqml_predict` function:

```sql
SELECT
  dataset_iris.*,
  sqml_predict(
    'Iris prediction',
    json_object(
      'sepal length (cm)', [sepal length (cm)],
      'sepal width (cm)', [sepal width (cm)],
      'petal length (cm)', [petal length (cm)],
      'petal width (cm)', [petal width (cm)]
    )
  ) AS prediction
FROM dataset_iris
LIMIT 1;
```

This will output the following data:

| sepal length (cm) | sepal width (cm) | petal length (cm) | petal width (cm) | target | prediction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.1 | 3.5 | 1.4 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

Yay! Our prediction is matching the target label!

Let's see if we can find some predictions not matching the target label.
To perform lots of predictions, we will use `sqml_predict_batch` which is more
efficient than `sqml_predict`:

```sql
SELECT
  dataset_iris.*,
  batch.value AS prediction,
  dataset_iris.target = batch.value AS match
FROM
  dataset_iris
  JOIN json_each (
    (
      SELECT
        sqml_predict_batch(
          'Iris prediction',
          json_group_array(
            json_object(
              'sepal length (cm)', [sepal length (cm)],
              'sepal width (cm)', [sepal width (cm)],
              'petal length (cm)', [petal length (cm)],
              'petal width (cm)', [petal width (cm)]
            )
          )
        )
      FROM
        dataset_iris
    )
  ) batch ON (batch.rowid + 1) = dataset_iris.rowid
WHERE match = FALSE;
```

This will yield the following output data:

| sepal length (cm) | sepal width (cm) | petal length (cm) | petal width (cm) | target | prediction | match |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.9 | 3.2 | 4.8 | 1.8 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 0 |
| 6.7 | 3.0 | 5.0 | 1.7 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 0 |
| 6.0 | 2.7 | 5.1 | 1.6 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 0 |
| 4.9 | 2.5 | 4.5 | 1.7 | 2.0 | 1.0 | 0 |

Oh no! 4 predictions have not predicted the correct target label!

Let's see if we can train a better algorithm to enhance the prediction quality.

### Training a new model

Let's use a Support Vector Machine algorithm, usually yielding better results
compared to the more simplistic Logistic Regression:

```sql
SELECT sqml_train(
  'Iris prediction',
  'classification',
  'svc',
  'dataset_iris',
  'target'
) AS training;
```

This will yield the following data:

| training |
| --- |
| {"experiment_name": "Iris prediction", "prediction_type": "classification", "algorithm": "svc", "deployed": true, "score": 0.9736842105263158} |

We can already see that the score of this new model is higher than the previous one and it has been deployed.

Let's try our new classifier on the same dataset:

```sql
SELECT
  dataset_iris.*,
  batch.value AS prediction,
  dataset_iris.target = batch.value AS match
FROM
  dataset_iris
  JOIN json_each (
    (
      SELECT
        sqml_predict_batch(
          'Iris prediction',
          json_group_array(
            json_object(
              'sepal length (cm)', [sepal length (cm)],
              'sepal width (cm)', [sepal width (cm)],
              'petal length (cm)', [petal length (cm)],
              'petal width (cm)', [petal width (cm)]
            )
          )
        )
      FROM
        dataset_iris
    )
  ) batch ON (batch.rowid + 1) = dataset_iris.rowid
WHERE match = FALSE;
```

This will lead the following results:

| sepal length (cm) | sepal width (cm) | petal length (cm) | petal width (cm) | target | prediction | match |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.9 | 3.2 | 4.8 | 1.8 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 0 |
| 6.7 | 3.0 | 5.0 | 1.7 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 0 |
| 6.0 | 2.7 | 5.1 | 1.6 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 0 |

Yay! We manage to predict one more target label with this new model!

Also note that we did not have to do anything to switch to the better model:
exactly the same query is used to perform the prediction without having to
specify anything about the new model! This is because new models are deployed
automatically for the current experiment only if their score outperforms the
score of the previously deployed model.
